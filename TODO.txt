TODO:
[] Set up timer and timing for the distributed implementation
[] Create a test script (probs in python .py files) to generate inputs and feed into our program (Just like the assignments)
   Test using 1,2,4,8 processes / threads -> produce graph and elaborate on the report
                                          -> Talk about speed up 
                                          -> Compare each of the implementations to serial version 
[] Talk about distributed implementation in the report 

*NOTE: We can use old assignment files and stuff
